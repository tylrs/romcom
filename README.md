## 2103 FE Paired Project Mod 1

## Technologies Used

The project itself is built with the use of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. We completed the project using Mac's native terminal and Atom text editor, utilizing the teletype extension to do collaborative paired programming and limiting potential for merge conflicts. We used github to track our changes and merge branches as we worked through each iteration.

## Overview

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well… maybe that’s true. We’re going to make an app that generates formulaic romance novel covers!

## Instructions for Running and Viewing Our Project

Upon launching our page, you will see a randomly generated romance novel cover that includes a randomly generated title and taglines.

Navigation for the site is at the top of the page, allowing users to click to generate a new random cover, save those covers if you like them, view those previously saved covers and even make your own! Each button is tied to event listeners making the page interactive. Buttons are as listed:
* Show New Random Cover
* Save Cover
* View Saved Covers
* Make Your Own Cover

In the View Saved Covers section, users can double click any previously saved covers to delete them if they don't like them....perhaps the romance has fizzled?
In the Make Your Own Cover section, users can use a form to generate any novel with their own source image, title and tagline....make up your own love life!

## Future Additions

If we had more time to take this project further, we would have loved to make the delete cover event handler adhere better to the DRY principle. We would have loved to also complete the optional extension:
* When a user single clicks a saved cover, create a modal to view it larger
* Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
