## Technologies Used

The project itself is built with the use of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. We completed the project using Mac's native terminal and Atom text editor, utilizing the teletype extension to do collaborative paired programming and limiting potential for merge conflicts. We used github to track our changes and merge branches as we worked through each iteration.

## Overview

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well… maybe that’s true. We’re going to make an app that generates romance novel covers!

## Instructions for Running and Viewing Our Project

Upon launching our page, you will see a randomly generated romance novel cover that includes a randomly generated title and taglines.

Navigation for the site is at the top of the page, allowing 

The top of the page gives you four options to play around with the romance novel data that we have stored, and will even allow you to add your own data!

The first button, reading from the left is "Show New Random Cover". Pressing this button will generate yet another random cover, title, and descriptor, right on the home screen.

If you like this cover, you can click the second button "Save Cover". This will add the cover you like to your saved covers page. You can view all these saved covers by pressing the third button "View Saved Covers".

Finally, the fourth button "Make Your Own Cover" will reveal four input fields where you can type the URL of an image you would like to see on a cover, a custom title, and two custom descriptors. Pressing the "Make my Book" button below these fields will display your new cover on the main page. At the same time, this button will also add the data you added to the original list, meaning your information has an opportunity to show up randomly as well.

<!--
README is well formatted and gives good context about the project. At minimum, a sufficient README should contain - contributors, technologies used, instructions for running and viewing the project, deploy link (gh-pages), images/GIFs if necessary, future additions, etc. Think about what a user needs to understand and get the full picture of the application. -->
